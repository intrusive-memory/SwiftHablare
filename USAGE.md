# SwiftHablaré Usage Guide

This guide summarizes the day-to-day tasks most automations perform when integrating or extending SwiftHablaré. It condenses the key workflows so AI agents can operate with minimal context switching.

## 1. Package Integration Checklist

1. Add the package to the `dependencies` array in your `Package.swift`:
   ```swift
   .package(url: "https://github.com/stovak/SwiftHablare", from: "1.0.0")
   ```
2. Add `SwiftHablare` to the target dependencies that need text-to-speech features.
3. Ensure the host app targets macOS 15/iOS 17 or newer and uses Swift 6.2 with Xcode 16.4 plus the Swift 6.2 toolchain (see below).
4. Link SwiftData in the host target (SwiftHablaré persists data through it).
5. On iOS/macOS, entitle the app for microphone/speaker usage when playing audio.

## 2. Bootstrapping the Manager

```swift
import SwiftData
import SwiftHablare

let container = try ModelContainer(for: AudioFile.self, VoiceModel.self)
let manager = VoiceProviderManager(modelContext: container.mainContext)
```

The manager auto-registers the built-in providers (`ElevenLabsVoiceProvider` and `AppleVoiceProvider`) and restores the last-selected provider from `UserDefaults`.

### Switching Providers

```swift
manager.switchProvider(to: .apple)
manager.switchProvider(to: .elevenlabs)
```

The helper `isCurrentProviderConfigured()` returns `true` when prerequisites (for example, an API key) are satisfied.

## 3. Managing Voices

```swift
let cachedVoices = try await manager.getVoices()
let freshVoices = try await manager.getVoices(forceRefresh: true)
```

Voice metadata is cached in SwiftData (`VoiceModel`). Refresh only when provider-side changes are expected.

To inspect or work with a provider directly:

```swift
if let provider = manager.getProvider(for: "elevenlabs"), await provider.isVoiceAvailable(voiceId: "voice-id") {
    let voices = try await provider.fetchVoices()
}
```

## 4. Generating Audio

### Cached Generation

```swift
let audio = try await manager.generateAndCacheAudio(
    text: "Hello World",
    voiceId: "voice-id",
    providerId: "elevenlabs",
    audioFormat: "mp3"
)
```

This method reuses cached audio if the same `(text, voiceId, providerId)` triple already exists, otherwise it stores the new result in SwiftData (`AudioFile`).

### Direct Generation

```swift
let rawData = try await manager.generateAudio(text: "Hello", voiceId: "voice-id")
```

Use this when you do not need persistence.

### Persisting to Disk

```swift
let outputURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/tmp/output.mp3")
try manager.writeAudioFile(audio, to: outputURL)
```

## 5. API Key Management

`KeychainManager.shared` stores sensitive provider credentials. Typical usage:

```swift
try KeychainManager.shared.saveAPIKey("your-api-key", for: "elevenlabs-api-key")
let key = try KeychainManager.shared.getAPIKey(for: "elevenlabs-api-key")
let isConfigured = KeychainManager.shared.hasAPIKey(for: "elevenlabs-api-key")
try KeychainManager.shared.deleteAPIKey(for: "elevenlabs-api-key")
```

## 6. SwiftUI Widgets Snapshot

SwiftHablaré ships SwiftUI helper views designed for macOS/iOS apps. They bind directly to `VoiceProviderManager` and the SwiftData models:

- `VoiceProviderWidget` – Picker for switching providers and showing provider status.
- `VoiceSettingsWidget` – Composite control for configuring providers and selecting voices.
- `VoicePickerWidget` – Standalone voice picker that supports searching, filtering, and previews.

Inspect the files under `Sources/SwiftHablare/UI/` for customizable sections. Automated agents can reuse these components in host apps without re-implementing the UI logic.

## 7. Common Automation Tasks

| Task | Call Sequence |
| --- | --- |
| Ensure provider credentials exist | `KeychainManager.shared.hasAPIKey` → `saveAPIKey` if missing |
| Refresh cached voice list | `await manager.getVoices(forceRefresh: true)` |
| Generate & persist audio | `await manager.generateAndCacheAudio` → `writeAudioFile` |
| Switch default provider | `manager.switchProvider(to:)` |
| Enumerate providers | `manager.getAvailableProviders()` |

Refer to [`API.md`](API.md) for type-level details when implementing new providers or extending the data models.

## Appendix: Local Swift 6.2 Toolchain Setup (macOS)

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_16.4.app/Contents/Developer
curl -L -o /tmp/swift-6.2-RELEASE-osx.pkg \
  https://download.swift.org/swift-6.2-release/xcode/swift-6.2-RELEASE/swift-6.2-RELEASE-osx.pkg
sudo installer -pkg /tmp/swift-6.2-RELEASE-osx.pkg -target /
export TOOLCHAINS=swift # aligns with the repository's .swift-version file
swift --version
```

Running `swift build`/`swift test` after these commands ensures the Swift 6.2 toolchain is active, preventing `swift-tools-version 6.2.0` incompatibility errors.
