# SwiftHablaré Development Methodology

## Overview

This document defines the phased, gated development methodology for SwiftHablaré v2.0. Each phase includes specific deliverables, quality gates, and testing requirements that must be met before proceeding to the next phase. This ensures comprehensive coverage of all requirements defined in REQUIREMENTS.md.

## Methodology Principles

1. **Gated Progression**: Each phase must pass all quality gates before the next phase begins
2. **Requirements Traceability**: Every requirement maps to specific tests and deliverables
3. **Incremental Validation**: Testing happens continuously, not just at the end
4. **AI-First Design**: Documentation and templates tested with AI code builders throughout
5. **Community Validation**: Early community involvement through feedback and testing

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **AI Service API Changes**: Providers may change APIs
   - **Mitigation**: Abstraction layer, version-specific implementations

2. **SwiftData Complexity**: Complex data models may be challenging
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental testing, clear examples

3. **Performance at Scale**: Large responses or many providers
   - **Mitigation**: Early performance testing, profiling

4. **AI Builder Documentation**: Docs may not work for AI assistants
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous AI builder testing throughout

5. **Community Adoption**: Community may not contribute
   - **Mitigation**: Low barrier to entry, good examples, active support

### Phase-Specific Risks

| Phase | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|------|--------|------------|
| Phase 1 | Protocol design flaws | High | External architecture review |
| Phase 2 | SwiftData migration issues | High | Extensive migration testing |
| Phase 3 | Rate limiting too restrictive | Medium | Configurable rate limits |
| Phase 4 | Keychain integration complexity | Medium | Early security review |
| Phase 5 | Provider API instability | High | Mock providers for testing |
| Phase 6 | UI complexity | Medium | Incremental component building |
| Phase 7 | Documentation inadequacy | High | External reviews, AI testing |
| Phase 9 | Low beta adoption | Medium | Active outreach, incentives |
